# Portfolio MacOs

A MacOs like portfolio with different features:
- Blog Posts with comments
- Projects Showcase
- Email contact me
- Books Library for books I'm reading, I've read, I want to read.

There are other features I'd like to add in the future, 

- My Photos, to show who I am and how I change.
- Projects automatically fetched from github profile
- A Terminal to interact with
- Smartphone view (Android like, this will make me change the repo name)
- ...
